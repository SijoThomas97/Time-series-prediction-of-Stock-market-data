Introduction

Predicting stock market prices is a challenging task due to the complex nature of financial markets and the presence of various factors influencing price movements. Time series analysis provides a powerful framework for modeling and forecasting sequential data, making it suitable for predicting stock prices.

This project utilizes time series analysis techniques to build predictive models for stock market prices. By analyzing historical price data and incorporating relevant features, the models aim to forecast future price movements with reasonable accuracy.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical stock market prices for the target stock. It typically includes features such as opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, trading volume, and date/time stamps. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code in this repository:

Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
[Additional libraries as specified in requirements.txt]
Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Obtain historical stock market data for the target stock.
Preprocess the data if necessary (e.g., handle missing values, normalize features).
Run the provided scripts to train and evaluate the predictive models.
Adjust parameters and experiment with different models as needed.
Methodology

The methodology employed in this project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features and transforming the data for modeling.
Model Selection: Choosing appropriate time series models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM).
Model Training: Fitting the selected models to the training data.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics.
Prediction: Generating forecasts for future stock prices using the trained models.
Results

The results of the predictive models are typically evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Visualizations such as time series plots and prediction vs. actual price plots may also be used to analyze the model's performance.

Future Improvements

Some potential areas for future improvement include:

Experimenting with different feature sets and data transformations.
Tuning model hyperparameters for better performance.
Exploring ensemble methods or advanced deep learning architectures.
Incorporating external factors such as news sentiment or macroeconomic indicators for enhanced prediction accuracy.
